          I am going into my third year of college as a computer science major. Not sure what I am specializing in. The logic portion of the questions given were hard to understand. The tutor helped me overcome it by explaining what the question meant, step by step. I also attempted some questions on my own with some push. I didn't care much about the grades, but 97% overall. I only cared about how to solve problems. The teaching style was a unique 1 on 1 experience. There was a lot of engagement between the tutor and student. The tutor gave practice problems and notes to go over. It helped me retain much more information. I am overall satisfied with this kind of experience. Thank you so much for your support!
